CerbomoticzGx
========================

This project is a series of modules which aim to integrate, automate and control the following systems and components.

- Victron Energy Equipment (Cerbo GX controlled Inverters, Solar MPPT charge controllers, etc.)
- Victron compatible LFP based Energy Storage Systems
- Tesla Electric Vehicles
- Tibber Smart Energy Supplier (hourly spot rate electricity supplier) API integration
- ABB B21/23/24 kWh meters
- Domoticz Home Automation System 


Current Features include:
- monitors a number of metrics from a Victron Energy CerboGX controlled system and reports these metrics back to
a Domoticz server via its REST API for monitoring and historic tracking
- Modular - Individual modules can be enabled or disabled in the ```.env``` file    
- Included a custom module which can be installed on a cerbo gx to read out ABB B2x kWh meters
- EV Charge Controller - Tesla vehicle charging at lowest rates or using only excess solar energy
- Grid Assisted vehicle charging mode for when you need to just charge at full rate regardless of cost
- Energy Broker module which attempts to buy energy at the lowest possible rate in a 48 hour period and store this in your home battery
- Tibber graphing module to generate visuals of the upcoming electricity prices (Thanks to [Tibberios](https://github.com/Lef-F/tibberios))
- Tibber API integration to constantly monitor current energy rates, daily consumption and production, forecasted pricing, etc
- deep integration with Victron system for monitoring and control via the cerbo Gx MQTT broker
- Creates, exports, and updates a number of custom metrics to the victron MQTT broker for consumption by the [venus-nextgen Energy Dashboard](https://github.com/JoshuaDodds/venus-nextgen)

Configuration for your CerboGX IP Address, VRM instance ID, and Domoticz IP/Port are configured in 
the ```.env``` configuration file. 

Note: The name of this project is a nod to both Victron Energy & the Domoticz project.
